## Ember Express App kit

This is a template for building ember with expressjs. This repo has most code from [Ember App kit](https://github.com/stefanpenner/ember-app-kit) except for the **server** folder. The server (*expressjs*) logic is from [Grunt-Express-Angular-Example](https://github.com/blai/grunt-express-angular-example)


### To use

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:vysakh0/ember-express.git
cd ember-express
bower install
npm install
grunt server
```

### Understanding the repo

#### Gruntfile

The Gruntfile is almost the same from Ember-App-kit, and this file has been organized neatly that you should take look at this [blog post](http://www.thomasboyt.com/2013/09/01/maintainable-grunt.html) to understand how things are organized.
